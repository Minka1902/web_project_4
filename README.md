web project 4
Michael Scharff

the project is a page of social media. you can see a picture of some very beutiful views and you can like them. you can edit the profile name and about me and can add a post. you can now exit any popup by clicking the "ESC" button or just clicking with your mouse on the popup overlay. i used the grid technique with the cards and flex with everything else.

there are 2 JS pages one CSS and one HTML.

BTW i do know i shouldnt do that but-thank you for the super useful review you helped me a lot and i really appreciate it.
